# System design study

This project it's a hands on related to system design topics.
The focus is to create a simple POC about microservices.

### The current project contains:
 - Kotlin as main language
 - Springboot as framework
 - MongoDb as database
 - Redis for cache
 - Kafka for Async 
 - Prometheus and Grafana for observability
 - Docker-compose for container orchestration

### Next Steps:

- Add github actions for CI
- Add custom alerts using Grafana
- Add Kubernetes to replace docker-compose and provide a load balancer and horizontal auto scaling

## How can you help me:

Since I'm using this project to learn about system design, I would really appreciate tips about
how to make things work better, or any review in what I have already created. 

For this I recommend the use of the issues sections.
